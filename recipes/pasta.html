        <h3><u>Steps</u></h3>
        <ol>
        <li>
            To a large pot or skillet, add a drizzle of olive oil and heat over MED-HIGH heat.  
            Add chicken, season with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Cook about 5 minutes, until chicken 
            is most of the way cooked through.  Remove to a plate.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Add onion and garlic to the pot and cook about 2-3 minutes, until soft.  Pour in marinara sauce, fill up empty sauce 
            jar with water and add to the pot.  Bring to a boil, then reduce to a strong simmer.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Add chicken and pasta, stir, then cover and cook for 10-15 minutes, until pasta is cooked to your liking.  Stir in parmesan cheese 
            and 1/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Sprinkle remaining 3/4 cup mozzarella cheese on top of the dish and cook another 2-3 minutes, until cheese is melted and gooey.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            Sprinkle with additional Italian seasoning if desired, and garnish with parsley or basil.
