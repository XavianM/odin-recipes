       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Tenderize the Chicken</strong>--Place a chicken thigh between two layers of plastic wrap. 
            Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the meat until it measures 1/4th inch thick. 
            You want the meat to be an even thickness so that it cooks evenly. Don't hit the chicken so hard that it tears.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Prepare Buttermilk Brine</strong>-— Stir 2 cups buttermilk with 2 tablespoons kosher salt until dissolved. Repeat as needed 
            to fully cover the chicken. Place chicken and brine in a ziplock bag on a rimmed plate and refrigerate for at least 
            1 hour, or up to 24 hours.
         </li>
         <p></p>
         <li><strong>Make Spicy Oil</strong>-— In a bowl, combine 1 grated garlic clove, a pinch of kosher salt, ¼ cup peanut oil, 2 tablespoons cayenne, ½ teaspoon 
            smoked paprika, and ½ teaspoon cumin. Mix and set aside with a pastry brush.
         </li>
         <p></p>
       <li>
            <strong>Stir Up The Mustard</strong>-- Toss 1 grated garlic clove, 1 tbsp pickle brine, ½ cup mayo, 1 tbsp whole grain mustard, and ¼ tsp smoked paprika 
            in a bowl. Mix it up and park it with a spoon for later.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep the Toppings</strong>-- Butter brioche buns, broil until golden, then keep warm at 200°F. Shred iceberg lettuce by quartering and slicing it 
            thinly—slice 2 dill pickles into coins. Set everything aside.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Get Ready to Fry </strong>-- Heat 2 quarts of peanut oil (or veggie oil if needed). In a bowl, toss together 2 cups flour, 2 tbsp cornstarch, 
            2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, ½ tsp salt, ½ tsp black pepper, and ¼ tsp cayenne.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep the Wet Mixture & Gear</strong>-- Whisk 2 cups buttermilk and 1 egg in a bowl. Grab your tools: Dutch oven, frying thermometer, metal tongs,
            spider strainer, instant-read thermometer, and a wire rack over a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Coat Chicken</strong>-- Heat 2 inches of oil in a deep pot to 325°F with a thermometer. Set up a wire rack. Mix dry and wet ingredients in separate 
            bowls. Dredge chicken in dry, dip in wet, dredge in dry again, shake off excess, and set on the rack.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Fry the Chicken</strong>-- Heat 2 inches of oil to 325°F and set up a wire rack. Mix dry and wet ingredients in separate bowls. Dredge chicken 
            dry → wet → dry, then fry 2 pieces at a time for 10–12 minutes, turning as needed. Keep oil around 325°F. Transfer to the rack, check for 175°F internal temp, 
            and brush with spicy oil if you like it hot.
        </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>
            <strong>Assemble and Serve</strong>-- Spread aioli on both sides of the warm buns. Layer 4–5 pickle slices on the bottom bun, top with a fried chicken thigh, 
            add ¼ cup shredded lettuce, and crown with the top bun. Serve right away and repeat for all four sandwiches.
        </li>
